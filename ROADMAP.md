# Potential Enhancements for the Application

## **File Security and Validation**

- **Validation of Uploaded Files**  
  Implement a mechanism to validate files uploaded by users to prevent malicious files from being stored on the server. This includes:

  - File type verification based on MIME types.
  - Scanning files for malware using external tools or services.
  - Restricting uploads of potentially harmful file extensions.

- **File Encryption**  
  Add encryption for files stored on the disk to enhance security. Features could include:
  - Server-side encryption for all files.
  - Per-user encryption keys for added privacy.
  - Transparent decryption during file download.

## **User Interface and Experience**

- **Text File Editor**  
  Introduce a built-in text editor in the GUI to allow users to view and edit simple text files directly within the application.

- **Enhanced GUI Design**  
  Improve the visual design and user experience of the web interface to make it more appealing and intuitive.

- **File and Folder Size Display**  
  Display the size of files and folders in the UI to give users a better understanding of their storage usage.

- **File Preview**  
  Allow users to view the contents of supported files (e.g., text, images, PDFs) without downloading them.

## **User Management and Authentication**

- **Email Verification**  
  Add email-based verification for new user accounts to ensure authenticity and reduce the likelihood of fake accounts.

- **Group Management**  
  Enable the creation of user groups with shared access permissions for specific files or folders. This feature would support collaborative workflows.

- **Improved User Authentication**  
  Enhance authentication mechanisms by making user-specific paths (`UserPath`) independent and relying on secure session-based authentication.

## **Sharing and Accessibility**

- **Public Links with Expiration**  
  Allow users to generate public links to files or folders with an expiration date for added security and temporary sharing.

- **ZIP File Support**  
  Add functionality to upload and download entire folders as ZIP archives to simplify bulk operations.

## **System Limitations and Optimization**

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Implement rate-limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints and ensure fair usage across users.

- **Resource Limits**  
  Introduce:
  - Maximum folder nesting depth to prevent overly complex structures.
  - Storage space limits per user based on account type.
  - Restrictions on the number of files or folders to optimize server performance.
  - Limit excessive API calls or high-frequency actions to prevent server overload and abuse.
